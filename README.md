### AngularJs
## apps.berlin.js 28 II February 2013

### Who am I?
* Marcin Wosinak
* 5 years experience in IT
  * WebDev: Javascript
  * C# dev: UnitTests
* Currently js contractor in Pozna≈Ñ, Poland

### What is AngularJs

* Who was already working with angular?
* Who likes having unit tests?
* Who is using yeoman?
* Who is going to ask questions?

### What is AngularJs

* it's application framework
* it's 29KB compressed and minified
 * backbone is 19KB (with underscore & backbone)
 * backbone is 32KB (with lodash & jQuery)
 * ember is 49KB
* no dependencies:
 * can use jQuery if available on loadtime

### AngularJs Overview
* MVVM [G+] [1]
* Plain js object
* Dependency injection
* TESTABILITY!
* Directives
* Declarative programming

### MVVM architecture
* plain js models
* dirty checking - but object.observer is comming

### Dependency injection
* increase testablity
* nice sumarize interconnections between parts of aplication

### Directives
* tools to teach html new tricks
 * binding controller
 * loops
 * binding models
* or bing back old ones
* No dom manipulation in controler

### Declarative programming
* What we have in html, css now is in js as well

### TESABILITY!
* Dependency injection
* Directives
* simple plain old js objects as models

### Doubt
* for some even deal breakers

### html validator are going to hate it
* those tags are invalide

```html
<tabs>
   <pane title="Localization">
```

* those atributs are invalide

```html
<li ng-repeat="todo in todos">
<input type="text" ng-model="todoText" />
```

* and this little guy was purpouse fully removed from html

```html
<blink></blink>
```

### Back to 90's?
* angular uses proprietery tags, allow us to create own, and expect us to write stuff like this:

```html
<form ng-submit="addTodo()">
<button ng-click="fireAlert()">
```

### No - it's our future
* web components
* shadow dom 

Will be native apis. Now we can get some of benefits with angular.
All is safly separeted into scopes.

### Yeoman
* CLI
* cool tool to creating code
* push changes form server to broswer - no refreshing

### Switching to AngularJs
* Is possible:)
* Goes well allong with jquery
* There is a project to rewrite bootstrap js to angular directives [angular-ui-bootstrap] [2]
* They say it is possible to use it along with require.js [angular-require-js] [3]
